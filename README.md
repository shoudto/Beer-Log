# BeerLog

## Overview
So many breweries and bars out there... it has suddently become hard to keep track. We try to use a pen and notebook but it can be such a hassle to carry. We beer drinkers would love a log of all the beers and review about them. With this Beer Log I have facilitated the tracking of all the tasted beers. You can signup as a new user or login, create and edit your first or many beer logs and delete the ones you no longer need. It is all done here on the Beer Log.

## Installation

## Usage
In my beer log application a welcome page will show and to access your personal beer log you would need to login if already a user or signup if you are a new user. You will be able to create, edit, update and delete your logs.
